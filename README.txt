The dataset that I used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

It contains 1000 observations of students' math, writing, and reading scores, along with other characteristics of the student such as their gender, race/ethnicity, the level of the parents' education, whether they were provided free lunch or not, and whether they took a preparatory course.

I have created a super simple linear regression model that uses gradient descent to minimise the mean squared error loss function. The dataset has been split up randomly into a ratio of 750/250 train and test sets

The linear model has a median error (predicted value - actual value) of -0.51978086007388669 and a mean error of -0.41897429467315789.
