The dataset that I used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

It contains 1000 observations of students' math, writing, and reading scores, along with other characteristics of the student such as their gender, race/ethnicity, the level of the parents' education, whether they were provided free lunch or not, and whether they took a preparatory course.
